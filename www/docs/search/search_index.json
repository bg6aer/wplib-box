Thus we believe it currently works with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO/S\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac OS X\n\n\nLatest 3 releases of OS X, at least\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nMost (all?) distros of Linux\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindows 7 thru 10\n\n\nWith PowerShell or \ngit-bash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe assume this will work on all these platforms but we have not tested it thoroughly yet so we welcome your bug reports if you have issues with it.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Hardware\n\n\nSince WPLib Box is distributed as a virtual machine image of a 64-bit distribution of Ubuntu Linux, a 64-bit Intel or AMD CPU is required, along with support for either Intel or AMD virtualization technologies: VT-x or AMD-v. You will need to enable VT-x/AMD-v in the host PC BIOS.\n\n\n\n\nRequired Software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Mac & Linux Users\n\n\nTo run WPLib Box requires the following software be installed:\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nVirtualBox\n\n\nInstall \nVagrant\n\n\n(\nVagrant Hosts Updater\n is also required but WPLib Box will automatically install it.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Windows Users\n\n\n\n\nInstall everything from the Mac & Linux Users list above\n\n\nEnsure that no other VM platform is running (either VMware or Hyper-V) as they will prevent VirtualBox from operating.\n\n\nInstall \nGit\n version 2 or greater \nOR\n download the \n.ZIP\n file and unzip instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickstart\n\n\nAfter making sure you have the necessary software, run the following commands \n\n\nFor Mac or Linux users:\n\n\n# cd ~/Sites, or cd into whichever directory you store your website projects in\ncd ~/Sites                \ngit clone https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box.git\ncd wplib-box\nvagrant up\nopen \"http://wplib.box\"\n\n\n\nFor Windows users:\n\n\n# cd into whichever directory you store your website projects in. \n# For example, your user profile: C:\\Users\\{current user}\\Sites\nc:\ncd %userprofile%\\Sites  \n#\n# You can run the next command, or just download from the web and unzip into the wplib-box directory\n#\ngit clone https://github.com/wplib/wplib-box.git\ncd wplib-box\nvagrant up\nexplorer \"http://wplib.box\"\n\n\n\nAfter this you should have a running WPLib Box via Vagrant and VirtualBox and a website loaded at the local \nwplib.box\n domain.\n\n\n\n\nSetting the Domain Name\n\n\nTo use WPLib Box for a local domain name other than \nwplib.box\n edit the \nHOSTNAME\n file  \n(with no extension)\n\nand replace the text \n\"wplib.box\"\n with your preferred local domain name \n(we recommend \n\"your-production-2nd-level-domain.dev\"\n e.g. if \ngoogle.com\n then use \ngoogle.dev\n):\n\n\nIn other words, change the \nentire contents\n of the \nHOSTNAME\n file from this:\n\n\nwplib.box\n\n\n\nTo \n(something like)\n this:\n\n\nexample.dev\n\n\n\nSave the changes to \nHOSTNAME\n and then run the following commands to reload the Vagrant configuration, and then open in your browser. \n(Be sure you replaced the domain name in the 2nd command with your own local domain name):\n\n\nvagrant reload\nopen \"http://example.dev\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the Local IP Address\n\n\nThe default local IP address used by this box is \n10.10.10.{octet}\n where \n{octet}\n is a number between 10 to 250.\n\n\nIf you need to change that for any reason simply \nedit the file named just \nIP\n \n(with no extension)\n found in the project root. It is created during \nvagrant up\n and a random \n{octet}\n is generated. Just edit this file and change the IP address it contains.\n\n\n\n\nDefault PHP Version\n\n\nThe default version for the box is \n7.0.x\n.  Instructions to \nswitch to PHP 5.6 or 7.1\n are on our FAQ.\n\n\n\n\nSwitching PHP Versions\n\n\nThe box has both PHP-FPM 5.6, 7.0, and 7.1. Instructions on how to select which version to use can be found in the \nFAQ\n.\n\n\n\n\nLogging into the WordPress Admin\n\n\nTo login to \nwplib.box/wp-admin/\n use the following credentials:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredential\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername:\n\n\nadmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassword:\n\n\npassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will probably change to using different username and password in the future.\n\n\n\n\nThe WordPress Database Credentials\n\n\nIf you want to access the database using a tool such as Sequel Pro the MySQL database name, username and password are all \nwordpress\n.\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n\ndefine( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );\ndefine( 'DB_USER', 'wordpress' );\ndefine( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'wordpress' );\n\n\n\nWe may change to using different MySQL credentials in the future.\n\n\n\n\nThe MySQL Credentials\n\n\nHere are the credentials you can use for accessing the MySQL database using a GUI such as Sequel Pro, Navicat, et al:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredential\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost Name\n\n\nwplib.box\n \n(or \nexample.dev\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPort\n\n\n3306\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername\n\n\nwordpress\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nwordpress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting to MySQL in Terminal\n\n\nThe MySQL server listens on all interfaces on port 3306. If you have the MySQL command-line client installed on your host machine, you can simply \nmysql --host wplib.box -u wordpress -pwordpress\n (assuming you are using the \nwplib.box\n hostname).\n\n\n\n\nThe SSH Credentials\n\n\nHere are the credentials you can use for the SSH tunnel:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredential\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost Name\n\n\nwplib.box\n \n(or\nexample.dev\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPort\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication Method\n\n\nPassword\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername\n\n\nvagrant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassword\n\n\nvagrant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogging into SSH as root\n\n\nThere is no \nroot\n user \nper-se\n in WPLib Box, only the \nvagrant\n user. You have to use either \nsudo\n for one-off commands, or you can \nuse the following command to switch to root\n:\n\n\nsudo -s\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging PHP with XDEBUG and PhpStorm\n\n\nSee instructions \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nInternet Sharing\n\n\nInternet sharing is implemented with \nlocaltunnel.me\n, which is pre-installed in the box image.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nIf you are having trouble with WPLib Box please check out our Troubleshooting section of our \nFAQ\n and/or you can also \nreach out to our support team\n for \nquick help\n on Slack and via other channels. \n\n\n\n\nHow are we the Best?\n\n\nHow have we been able to make \nWPLib Box\n the:\n\n\n\n\nEasiest\n, \n\n\nFastest\n and \n\n\nLeast Problematic\n Vagrant box for local WordPress development\n\n\nPlus \nNo-Fuss PhpStorm+XDEBUG Debugging\n?\n\n\n\n\nBecause \nwe took the blinders off\n.  We ignored the lead of everyone else who has created a Vagrant box for WordPress development and we rethought how a Vagrant box should be designed, using a blank canvas.  \n\n\nInstead of starting with a standard Linux distribution image as a base box \u2014 such as \nprovided by Ubuntu\n \u2014 and then using Puppet, Chef or Ansible to provision the box \non your computer while running inside\n of your \nVagrantfile\n \nwe provision and test the box IN ADVANCE\n.  \n\n\nOur \nProvision-in-Advance\n approach practically eliminates all the hair-pulling and infuriatingly unproductive time you frequently have to spend to solve an obscure provisioning issue in a script that you did not develop and thus know almost nothing about when you use one of the other boxes for local WordPress development. WPLib Box bypasses all those headaches for you and saves you tons of time!\n\n\nWhat this means for you is that the only thing your \nVagrantfile\n must do is: \n\n\n\n\nSpecify \nour base box\n, \n\n\nSet your local domain name and local IP address, \n\n\nMount your source code directory into the VM, and  \n\n\nExtract WordPress core files from a ZIP file \n(but we only run this step on (re-)provisioning.)\n \n\n\n\n\nBadda-bing, badda-bang; as Steve Jobs would say: \nIt Just Works!\n\n\nGive it a try and see if you don't agree.\n\n\n\n\n3rd Party WPLib Box Projects\n\n\n\n\nWPLib Box Maker\n from \nArtOfWP\n: \nGenerates a custom WPLib Box setup using \nYeoman\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus of Issues\n\n\nWe are using Waffle.io to help us manage our GitHub issue queue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Plans\n\n\nWe have many plans for the WPLib platform.

Because  we took the blinders off .  We ignored the lead of everyone else who has created a Vagrant box for WordPress development and we rethought how a Vagrant box should be designed, using a blank canvas.    Instead of starting with a standard Linux distribution image as a base box \u2014 such as  provided by Ubuntu  \u2014 and then using Puppet, Chef or Ansible to provision the box  on your computer while running inside  of your  Vagrantfile   we provision and test the box IN ADVANCE .    Our  Provision-in-Advance  approach practically eliminates all the hair-pulling and infuriatingly unproductive time you frequently have to spend to solve an obscure provisioning issue in a script that you did not develop and thus know almost nothing about when you use one of the other boxes for local WordPress development. WPLib Box bypasses all those headaches for you and saves you tons of time!  What this means for you is that the only thing your  Vagrantfile  must do is:    Specify  our base box ,   Set your local domain name and local IP address,   Mount your source code directory into the VM, and    Extract WordPress core files from a ZIP file  (but we only run this step on (re-)provisioning.)     Badda-bing, badda-bang; as Steve Jobs would say:  It Just Works!  Give it a try and see if you don't agree.",
